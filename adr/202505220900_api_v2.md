| Issue        | Sloth is getting a new UI which is not created within the exisiting Flask application. In fact the new admin UI is in a Next.js application for that there needs to be some modifications on the API part of the system.<br/><br/>The issue with that Sloth is in need of a refactoring in general to deal with technical debt that has accumulated over the past five, six years. |
| Decision     | Starting with a new version of API seems to be the right idea for the time being. The major refactoring will happen as the new routes for version 2 of API will be deployed.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Consequences | Some routes are easy to fix or require no change at all. Others will need more effort to get them working correctly.<br/><br/>An upside to this is that the new API will be covered by tests, most likely with Cypress.                                                                                                                                                            |
