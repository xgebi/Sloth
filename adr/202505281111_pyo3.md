| Issue        | Original issue is low performant parts of the code. This is being solved by integrating Rust parts to speed things up. The part that was an issue was how to connect Python and Rust.      |
| Decision     | First approach was to use microservice that generates the results. After attempting to implement the calls, it was obvious that PyO3 integration is probably better solution in this case. |
| Consequences | The main consequence is that Sloth won't have three service but just two, main and UI, when the refactoring is done.                                                                       |
