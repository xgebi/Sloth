| Context      | This project needs testing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Decision     | There are several decisions. First is to use Cypress. The reason for it is that I'm comfortable with it. Unless there's a feature that's needed, there's no reason to look at other testing tools like Selenium.<br/><br/>Second decision is to use Cypress per project and not global one. |
| Consequences | Second decision is the more important one as it allows for more modular approach to testing. Global cypress would make sense to test the whole chain end to end.                                                                                                                            |
